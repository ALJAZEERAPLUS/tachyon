# Installation

Install the Tachyon plugin as a regular plugin in your WordPress install (mu-plugins also supported).

You also need to point the plugin to your [Tachyon server](server.md). Add the following to your `wp-config-local.php`:

```php
define( 'TACHYON_URL', 'http://localhost:8080/<bucket name>/uploads' );
```
