Tachyon is built with some strong opinions and assumptions:

- Runs on AWS (using CloudFront, Lambda and API Gateway.)
- Expects original image files to be stored on Amazon S3.
- Only supports simple image resizing, not a full image manipulation service.

Tachyon works best with WordPress, coupled with [S3 Uploads](github.com/humanmade/s3-uploads) and the [Tachyon Plugin](https://github.com/humanmade/tachyon-plugin).

## Installing

Tachyon is simple to install, just use the `cloudformation-template.json` in this repository to create the whole stack using AWS CloudFormation. It will ask you for a few details along the way.

You'll need to upload the latest release to Amazon S3 and put the location in the to the CloudFormation stack configuration.

## Using

Tachyon provides a simple HTTP interface in the form of:

`https://{tachyon-domain}/my/image/path/on/s3.png?w=100&h=80`

It's really that simple!

#### Args Reference

| URL Arg | Type | Description |
|---|----|---|
|`w`|Number|Max width of the image.|
|`h`|Number|Max height of the image.|
|`quality`|Number, 0-100|Image quality.|
|`crop`|Boolean or "100,50,20,100"|Whether to crop the image, or resize proportionally.|

## Credits
Created by Human Made for high volume and large-scale sites, such as [Happytables](http://happytables.com/). We run Tachyon on sites with millions of monthly page views, and thousands of sites.

Written and maintained by [Joe Hoyle](https://github.com/joehoyle).

Tachyon is inspired by Photon by Automattic. As Tachyon is not an all-purpose image resizer, rather it uses a media library in Amazon S3, it has a different use case to [Photon](https://jetpack.com/support/photon/).

Tachyon uses the [Sharp](https://github.com/lovell/sharp) (Used under the license Apache License 2.0) Node.js library for the resizing operations, which in turn uses the great libvips library.
